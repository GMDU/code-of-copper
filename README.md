# Code of Copper
**A Datapack by Moxvallix, Gears and Wulfian.**

## Overview
Code of Copper is a lore heavy, and technically advanced Datapack, adding a programmable Copper Golem into the game.

Throughout the world, different structures will generate, containing lore, and examples of programs that the Copper Golem can run. Programs can be written into a book, and then given to the Golem, by right clicking it with the book.

Shift-right-clicking the Golem will execute it's current program.

## Getting Started
First, you will need to find a Copper Golem. These can be found high in the sky, within Airships. Be warned; these can be dangerous!

You can obtain the Copper Golem as an item by breaking it. It can then be placed wherever you wish for it to be.

### Writing your First Program
It is up to you to discover most of the language through exploration; example programs are found scattered across the world.

However, every good README needs a hello world.
```
print "Hello, World!
```
This can be written into a book, and right-clicked into a Copper Golem. Shift-right-click to run.
